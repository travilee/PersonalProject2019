                                    <p>I was very lucky to have Travis as a supervisor at Good Samaritan Project. He was always available and supportive to me when I had questions or needed support. He is personable yet professional and I would without hesitation trust any advice or guidance he gave me. Everyone at the agency, and the community partners we worked with, felt that way toward Travis. Travis earns the respect of everyone he works with by being knowledgeable, considerate, skilled, and passionate. I would recommend him for a wide variety of positions because I know he can excel at anything he sets out to do and any workplace would be lucky to have him.</p>

                                    <p>In the time I spent working with Travis he was a strong member of the Education and Outreach team. I found him to be very approachable and responsive. Travis was never judgmental or self-serving, an important characteristic to have in the field of sex education. He showed the utmost integrity in all his projects and duties.</p>
                                    <p>Travis took his responsibilities to the community very seriously and brought new ideas to the table. Travis was well informed and continually seeking new avenues to gain more knowledge. We were all sorry to see Travis go but his commitment to making a lasting impact on the community took him to positions with a larger constituency. Thank you Travis for your contributions to the team.</p>
                                    <p>If you have an opportunity to work with Travis I would not hesitate.</p>

                                    <p>While I was CEO of Good Samaritan Project, I hired Travis Barnhart as the Director of Prevention, and it was one of the best decisions I made. He was able to take a somewhat dysfunctional department and turn it around so that it became a well-run part of the organization. He was able to mend some major fences, which helped restore contract funding that had been lost.</p>
                                    <p>Travis was always willing to do whatever needed to be done, and got along well with not only his staff, but the other managers and staff as well. He earned the respect of his staff, co-workers, and his peers in other agencies as well.</p>

                                    <p>I have known Travis for well over a decade through work in the sexual health arena. For I think around 4+ of those years, we actually worked closely together as part of the management team at a local non-profit. While I can't really speak to the experience and knowledge Travis has with computer programming and development, I can tell you that he was our resident IT specialist here. We would always go to him when there was some sort of technology glitch. He is very smart and quick to solve problems and always looking for solutions to make things run more efficiently. Not only that, Travis is one of the most kind and helpful people I have ever known. He has a gift for bringing people together and making them care, and for that reason, he is invaluable on a team.</p>
                                    <p>He is organized, dedicated, reliable and loyal. He is pretty much the winning lottery ticket of employees. I miss working with him and miss all he brought to our agency, but fortunately still have him in my life as a friend. I cannot recommend him enough for any position. He will bring something special to wherever he goes.</p>
